    <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a></h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language 
        used for specifying the presentation and styling of a 
        document written in a markup language such as HTML or 
        XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).</p>
        <p>[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide 
        Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>[2]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content 
        and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.</p>
        <p>[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;
        [further explanation needed] provide more flexibility
         and control in the specification of presentation 
         characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share 
         formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate.</p>
         <p>css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the 
         structural content; and enable the .css file to be 
         cached to improve the page load speed between the 
         pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
